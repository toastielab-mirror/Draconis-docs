1. Click the “Files” option in the navbar of your server
2. You will be shown a list of your server’s files

Whilst inside the files tab, there are a few handy tips and tricks to know:

- To edit a file, if it is one of the supported file extensions, just click the file name and it will automatically open in the built-in file editor. Once you’re done, just click Save to save the file back to your server. This also works for `.log.gz` files, you do not need to unzip them before opening them as the editor will do this automatically.
- To download a file, click the three dots at the end of the file and select download. If you wish to download a folder, or a ZIP of multiple files at once, just tick the files then click the “Archive” button at the bottom of the page and the File Manager will automatically ZIP the files and then you can download them like you would a normal file.
- To upload a file/folder, just drag the files straight onto the webpage, or use the Upload button

- To extract a ZIP file, go to the folder where the ZIP is located and click the three dots at the end of the file name and select unarchive. Please note this does not support `.rar `files, only `.zip` and `.tar.gz`
- To rename files, click the three dots at the end of the file name and select rename. Please note that the destination must not exist already.
- To delete files, select the checkbox next to as many files as you wish, then click the Delete button at the bottom of the page. This will automatically delete them at a fast speed so even large folders such as Dynmap can be deleted, unlike with SFTP
- To move files, select the files which you wish to move, click the three dots at the end of the file name and select move. Enter the full path to the directory you wish to move the files, for example `/plugins/WorldEdit/schematics`.
