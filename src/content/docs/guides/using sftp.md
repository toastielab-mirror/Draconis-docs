:::note

This may need a little bit of technical stuff but this guide should help you as much as it can

:::

- You will need to install FileZilla from [their website](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php). When installing it, make sure to click No to any advertisements or prompts for unwanted software.
- Inside your panel, go to the `Settings` tab, then to the `SFTP Details` portion of the page:

- Open Filezilla. On the top, you should see a ‘Quick Connect’ bar.
- In the ‘Host’ box enter the `FTP URI` from the gamepanel.
- Enter your gamepanel password into the ‘Password’ box.
